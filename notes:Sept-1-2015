Example 1:

	7 flavors of ice cream 

	2 pints (pints refer to the number of variables per stack)

	if repeating flavors is allowed then solution would be 7 * 7 which is 49

How to solve Example 1 if repeate is not allowed:
                             
	AA BB CC DD EE FF GG -> Number of Twins = 7
	AB BC CD DE EF FG
	AC BD BE DF EG    1
	AD BE BF DG    2
	AE BF BG    3
	AF BG    4
	AG    5
	   6
	7

	So 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28
	
	Result: 28 combinations that do not repeat 

Questions to ask when solving these problems:
1) Is repetition allowed?
2) Does order matter?

Example 2:

	5 flavors of ice cream
	
	3 pints (pints refer to the number of variables per stack)

	RULES: 
	->All three variables match
	->All three variables are different
	->Two variables match and 1 is different


Start with Two variables match and 1 is different: 

       1 AAB BBA CCA DDA EEA
       2 AAC BBC CCB DDB EEB
       3 AAD BBD CCD DDC EEC 
       4 AAE BBE CCE DDE EED
	 1   2   3   4   5

	-> 20 combo


Next lets do the one where all three variables are different:

       1 ABC
       2 ABD
       3 ABE
       4 ACD
       5 ACE
       6 ADE
       7 BCD
       8 BCE
       9 BDE
      10 CDE
         1

	-> 10 combo 

Finally we know we have 5 variables so there has to be 5 combo where they are all the same


Result: 
	9 + 20 + 5 = 34 combos
