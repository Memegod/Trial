Proof Work:
(Statement)If a and b are consecutive integers then a^2 + b^2 -1 is a multiple of 4

Needs a Proof...Use correct format from previous notes 

alternate way to solve 

THE CASE method:

Case well a is even
n = a^2
m = (a+1)^2
___________
Case were a is odd
n = a^2
m = (a-1)^2

Important Material:

To show something is a multiple of 4 write as = 4(variable)
if(a + b + c is a multiple of 4), then(100a + 10b + c is a multiple of 4)
key step: a+b+c = 9j where j is an element of all integers
syntax: 100a + 10b + c = 9(variable)

Truth Tables:

Example 1:

If p then q = (p => q)

p = TTFF
q = TFTF 
(p=>q) = TFTT

//Hint: the only way to get p => q is false is when p is true but q is false

Example 2:

If p then q and If q then p = (p<==>q) 

p = TTFF
q = TFTF
(p<==>q) = TFFT

Example 3:

p = TTTTFFFF
q = TTFFTTFF
r = TFTFTFTF
qVr = TTTFTTTF
not(qVr) = FFFTFFFT
p^not(qVr) = FFFTFFFF

//Lol Venn Diagrams are easy guys just literally shade in everything that is false and leave everything that is
//true unshaded
