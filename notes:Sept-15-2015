Important Material:
The statements p=>q, not(q)=>not(p), and not(p)Vq are all equivalent

The contrapositive is when you flip the p and the q and make them both not 

Example:

(Statement) if n is even then n^2 is even 
(Contradiction) if n is not even, then n^2 is not even 

Proof:
Assume n is not even 
Then we know n is odd, so n = 2k+1 for some integer k
Therefore, n^2 = (2k+1)
4(k^2) + 4k + 1 
=2(2(k^2) + 2k) + 1
Let j = 2(k^2)+2k then n^2 = 2j + 1,
where j is an integer because k was 
that proves that n^2 is odd so n^2 is
not even
Q.E.D Since the contrapositive statement is true, so is the original
