Proof Work:
(Statement): If q is odd then n^2 + n is even 
Proof:
Suppose n is odd 
That means n = 2k + 1 for some integer k
Therefore n^2 + n = (2k + 1)^2 + (2k + 1)
= 4k^2 + 6k + 2
= 2(2k^2 + 6k + 1)
We know that 2k^2 + 2k + 1 is an integer 
Let j = 2k^2 - 3k -1
so n^2 + n = 2j
so n^2 + n is even 
Q.E.D

Important Material:
You can never proove a theorem by example 
You can disproove a theorem by a wrong example 
ex. The sum of two prime numbers is even 

Proof Work:
(Statement):If p is prime and q is prime then p+q is even
This is false,
Let p = 2 //we know that 2 is prime 
Let q = 3 //we know that 3 is prime 
However p + q = 5 and 5 is not even 
So the conclusion is false 
Thus the statement is therefore false Q.E.D

(Statement):If p is a perfect square and q is a perfect square then p + q is even 
//We will disprove this statement using a counterexample 
Verify Conditions:
Let p=25, 25 is a perfect square => sqr(25) = 5
Let q=4, 4 is a perfect square => sqr(4) = 2
However p+q = 25 + 4 = 29 
29 is not even, therefore the conclusion is false,
thus the statement is false Q.E.D 

Other Review:
In a list of 15 
there are at least 3 subsets that have the same sum 

How many subsets are there? 
-> 2^15 
Smallest possible sum?
-> must be greater than 0
Largest possible sum?
->less than 15(QQQ)
->less than 15000 different sums
