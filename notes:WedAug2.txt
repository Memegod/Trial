->Problem Solving Lifecycle 
        -> 1. Describe the problem 
	-> 2. Analyze the problem //Input? //Output? //Constraints on input?
				 //Relationship Information (Equations?)
	-> 3. (HARD STEP): Design the algorithm //Outline Method //Flow Chart  	
	-> 4. Test your Algorithm
	-> 5. Implement Algorithm //Implement means write the code for 
				 //the Algorithm
	-> 6. Test Implementation
