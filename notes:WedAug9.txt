{Every value has an associated type} 

Data Types: 

->Sets of values and operations 
->Literal:
	= Any value that is written out

The Four Primitive Types:

->Integers 
->Real #s (floating point numbers)
->Characters (letters/symbols)
->Boolean values (true or false)

Integers (3 types):

->int(standard integer) = 4 bytes (32 bits) = 2^32
->short = 2 bytes //used if want to save space
->long = 8 bytes //used if have more space not care about efficiency

Characters (1 type (only 1 keyword)):

->char = 1 byte 
->ASCII 
->'8'

Floating Point #s (3 keywords):

->float = 4 bytes 
->double = 8 bytes
->long double = 16 bytes

Boolean Values (1 keyword):

->bool(true/false)

Others:

->String
->Anything in " " is a string literal 
->Must #include <string> to use
